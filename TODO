Scripting framework ideas:
Display API?

Multiple selection in treeview
Drag reorganise items in tree - option to show popup menu in dragged order?

CouchDB backend (UbuntuOne)

Combine into single source tree

Get rid of commented out code
Add method comments

Add spell checker with a hotkey which checks the last word typed
This can probably be done with a script once the script interface is implemented

FUTURE: Daemon to handle multiple connections (e.g. multiple logged-in users)
