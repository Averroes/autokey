Add toolbar with following functions:
    New folder
    New phrase
    Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete
    Record Keystrokes
    
Allow hotkeys to have no modifiers - but modifiers cannot be hotkeys
UI has been updated to permit it, but refactor of IoMediator and PhraseService required
Will now have single entry point - handle_keypress (key, modifiers, windowName)

Sentence delimiter for recently typed to be improved - not just full stop. 

Implement a record keystrokes function

ExpansionService to be renamed PhraseService

Hotkey and abbreviation detection code to come out of PhraseService into common base class for
PhraseService and ScriptService

Get rid of commented out code
Add method comments

Add gettext support

Add spell checker with a hotkey which checks the last word typed
This can probably be done with a script once the script interface is implemented

FUTURE: Daemon to handle multiple connections (e.g. multiple logged-in users)

FUTURE: PLUGIN Capitalisation autocorrect feature (track last correction and don't re-correct if it's repeated)
Option to activate/deactivate above feature
