Experiment with sending cursor keys, home, function keys, etc.

Expand abbreviation functionality so it is more versatile, I'd like to
come up with a mechanism by which we can pass arguments to
abbreviations.

Find a way to present visual queues to the user

Create a shorcut key to toggle abbrevs on and off.

Automatic keyboard detection is a must.  Having the user tell the
program what they're using is lame!  Plus it breaks if the user
changes keyboard layouts while the program is running!  I also think
that this is likely to cause problems with international keyboards,
hindering the program's adoption.  The only keyboard layouts I'm
familiar with are qwerty and dvorak.

I would like to have *some* kind of user interface, however minimal.
The zenity script hacks are lame.  Plus, the only way to close the
program is to "killall autokey.py" from a terminal.  However, I
think I don't want this implemented directly in the program.  I want
other programs to communicate directly with my program as a sort of
backend.

I think it would also be nice to be able to specify a black list of
windows to avoid typing text expansions to.

I need to clean up and refactor the code.  It's turned into a mess.  I
went through one phase of refactoring, but I'm definitely going to
need another.
