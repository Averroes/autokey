Create API files from scripting module using docstrings

Scripting framework ideas:
Namespace for window management (making it useful might be tough)
Namespace for performing shell tasks (mainly aliases for shutil and subprocess)
Namespace for autokey stuff - create/modify/delete folders/phrases/scripts, show popup menu
Namespace for clipboard interaction
    - put text in selection
    - put text in buffer
    - load image into buffer from file
    - paste from selection

Get rid of commented out code
Add method comments

Add spell checker with a hotkey which checks the last word typed
This can probably be done with a script once the script interface is implemented

FUTURE: Daemon to handle multiple connections (e.g. multiple logged-in users)
