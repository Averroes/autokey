Config page for script editor
Create API files from scripting module using docstrings

Scripting framework ideas:
Namespace for window management (making it useful might be tough)
Namespace for showing simple dialogs (using the 'kdialog' package)
Namespace for performing shell tasks (mainly aliases for shutil and subprocess)
Namespace for autokey stuff - create/modify/delete folders/phrases/scripts, show popup menu

Get rid of commented out code
Add method comments

Add spell checker with a hotkey which checks the last word typed
This can probably be done with a script once the script interface is implemented

FUTURE: Daemon to handle multiple connections (e.g. multiple logged-in users)

FUTURE: PLUGIN Capitalisation autocorrect feature (track last correction and don't re-correct if it's repeated)
Option to activate/deactivate above feature
