Scripting framework ideas:
Namespace for window management (making it useful might be tough)
Namespace for autokey stuff - create/modify/delete folders/phrases/scripts, show popup menu

Notify on script failure, rather than just logging the error

Get rid of commented out code
Add method comments

Add spell checker with a hotkey which checks the last word typed
This can probably be done with a script once the script interface is implemented

FUTURE: Daemon to handle multiple connections (e.g. multiple logged-in users)
