FEATURES
================

Currently, abbreviations are case insensitive.  This is because the
hotstring_logger program only receives keypress events, so there's no
way to reliably track the status of the shift key.  I would like to
have this fixed so I can tell the case of the letter in the
abbreviations and expand the abbreviations according to the case
pattern as in Emacs.

Automatic keyboard detection is a must.  Having the user tell the
program what they're using is lame!  Plus it breaks if the user
changes keyboard layouts!  I also think that this is likely to cause
problems with international keyboards, hindering the program's
adoption.  The only keyboard layouts I'm familiar with are qwerty and
dvorak.

I would like to have *some* kind of user interface, however minimal.
The zenity script hacks are lame.  Plus, the only way to close the
program is to "killall hotstring.py" from a terminal.

I need a way to switch off abbrevs temporarily, but I think that's
going to hinge on the completion of some sort of systray gui program.

I think it would also be nice to be able to specify a black list of
windows to avoid typing text expansions to.

I need to clean up and refactor the code.  It's turned into a mess.
