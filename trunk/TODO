Scripting framework ideas:
Namespace for window management (making it useful might be tough)
Namespace for showing simple dialogs (using the 'dialog' package)
Namespace for performing shell tasks (mainly aliases for shutil and subprocess)

Namespace for persistent values to allow scripts to store stuff between invocations
Namespace for dialogs using kdialog

FUTURE: PLUGIN Capitalisation autocorrect feature (track last correction and don't re-correct if it's repeated)
Option to activate/deactivate above feature
