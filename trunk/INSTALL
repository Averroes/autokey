This REQUIRES the python-xlib package to run.  On Debian or Ubuntu
systems, the package name is python-xlib, just apt-get it.

There's no ./configure, just type make and make install.  Type make
uninstall if you don't like it.

Be sure to copy the example abbr.ini to $HOME/.abbr.ini

Type autokey.py into a terminal to run the program.  If the last key
you use to break up the expansion seems to be typed twice, or if the
expansion seems to expand too late, try playing with wait_time values
on the command line.

kill it from a terminal with 'killall autokey.py'
