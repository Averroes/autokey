=== What is the license of AutoKey ? ===

=== Does AutoKey work with scripts which were written with the popular AutoHotKey Windows application? ===
No. AutoKey's built-in Python scripting is arguably much more powerful than the AHK language and makes it possible to do many of the things that AutoHotKey scripts can do on Windows, in addition to some things AHK doesn't support.

=== Is AutoKey available on Microsoft Windows? ===
No. There are similar alternatives on Windows like [http://www.autohotkey.com/ AutoHotKey]

=== Is there a way to run AutoKey in a daemon mode that is in background and without a tray icon or from a shell script? ===
Run 'autokey' with an & while making sure that the preference (Settings->Advanced Settings) "Show a tray icon" in unselected.

Now when you want to see the Configuration window again while Autokey is running in in daemon mode, you can press the Special Hotkey which you assigned in the Settings->Advanced Settings->Special Hotkeys->Use a hotkey to show configuration window.

=== Can I temporarily suspend/resume AutoKey? ===
To toggle Autokey from suspend/resume, use the hotkey which you have specified in Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Special Hotkeys->Use a hotkey to toggle expansions. Alternatively this can be controlled from the tray icon's popup menu, or from the Settings menu in the configuration window.

=== What are the trigger characters? ===
The default trigger characters are dependent on your locale. They are any characters that are not normally considered part of a word. For English locales, these are characters like Enter (Return), Tab, Space and punctuation, among others.

=== Where is my configuration information stored? Can I move those to other machines? ===
This information is stored in the user's home directory under the folder .config/autokey/autokey.json

=== Does AutoKey work on Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope)? ===
