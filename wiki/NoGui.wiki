= Introduction =

This page contains a basic example on how to use the No-GUI API included with AutoKey 0.6x


= Details =
The No-GUI API allows you to use AutoKey without the GUI. Eventually, this will be available as a separate package without the KDE dependencies. The API uses an imperative/C-like style to make things as simple as possible.

First, you need the main Python script that will initialise everything:

{{{
from autokey.nogui import *

create_abbreviation("brb", "be right back")
load_script_file("test.aks")

s = create_script("doSomething")
set_abbreviation(s, "adf")

s = create_script("somethingElse")
set_abbreviation(s, "st2")

start(True)
}}}

Save this as e.g. `test.py`

Next, you need the file containing the script 'blocks' (blocks of Python code delimited by tags to identify them) which is used in `load_script_file()` and `create_script()`:

{{{
<doSomething>
keyboard.send_keys("I did something!")

<somethingElse>
keyboard.send_keys("This is another script")
}}}

Save this as `test.aks` (referred to in the call to `load_script_file()`)

Note: In this example each script is only a single line, but of course you could have multiple lines of code for each script. Everything must be properly indented according to normal Python rules.

Now, if you run the test.py script (i.e. `python test.py`), AutoKey will start in no-gui mode with the scripts and abbreviation defined above.
