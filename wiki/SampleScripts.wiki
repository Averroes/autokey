= Introduction =

This page contains some very basic script examples to demonstrate the capabilities of AutoKey's scripting service.

For specific details on the custom functions available to AutoKey scripts, see the [http://autokey.sf.net/apidoc API reference].

= Scripts =

===Insert Current Date/Time===

This script uses the simplified system.exec_command() function to execute the Unix `date` program, get the output, and send it via keyboard output

{{{
output = system.exec_command("date")
keyboard.send_keys(output)
}}}

===List Menu===

This script shows a simple list menu, grabs the chosen option and sends it via keyboard output.

{{{
choices = ["something", "something else", "a third thing"]

retCode, choice = dialog.combo_menu(choices)
if retCode == 0:
    keyboard.send_keys("You chose " + choice)
}}}

===X Selection===

This script grabs the current mouse selection, then erases it, and inserts it again as part of a phrase.

{{{
text = clipboard.get_selection()
keyboard.send_key("<delete>")
keyboard.send_keys("The text %s was here previously" % text)
}}}

===Persistent Value===

This script demonstrates 'remembering' a value in the store between separate invocations of the script.

{{{
if not store.has_key("runs"):
    # Create the value on the first run of the script
    store.set_value("runs", 1)
else:
    # Otherwise, get the current value and increment it
    cur = store.get_value("runs")
    store.set_value("runs", cur + 1)
    
keyboard.send_keys("I've been run %d times!" % store.get_value("runs"))
}}}
